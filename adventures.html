                <h2>Another Cup of Tea</h2>
                <p>June 2016</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Today I took a spontaneous (loving that word lately) trip downtown to grab a cup of tea at The Tea
                    Party again. I did say I was going to return soon! It was really last minute, and while I usually
                    hate last minute things, this one brought me joy.
                    <br><br>
                    I brought along the book I am currently reading, 1984 by George Orwell, and it resulted in some very
                    unexpected attention. It was such an amazing feeling knowing that something as small as a book could
                    start a conversation between 2 strangers; twice! One of the waitresses casually asked which book I
                    was reading, and was surprised I didn’t read 1984 in high school! She said she enjoys it better now
                    because it does include some heavy material that a high-schooler may not comprehend. The other
                    waitress hadn’t read it either and asked for my opinion on it. I hadn’t read alot to begin with, so
                    I didn’t have much of an opinion but it was nice talking about books.
                    <br><br>
                    I went alone again, and the feelings I had from before still stayed the same. It’s nice to have a
                    break from people and entertain no one but yourself.
                    Before arriving, I had a confession conversation with a close friend that relieved a lot of stress
                    off my shoulders. And a cup of tea afterwards was just what I needed. During that conversation I
                    reinforced my need to doing things for myself; whether it is making a decision or plainly treating
                    myself to some me-time. Going to The Tea Party wasn’t just a treat, it was baby steps in forming a
                    habit, and reaching a personal goal.
